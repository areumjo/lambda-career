### SMART
- **Specific**:
    - Specificity helps you know the who, what, where, and how of your goals.
    - Create an actionable plan for how you’ll get a job, who can help you, where you will go to find one, or what you need to do every day. 

- **Measurable**:
    - How do you know if you’re on track to meeting your goals?
    - Measurable goals are concrete goals like making a your daily/weekly to-do list.

- **Achievable**:
    - Goals should be motivating and rewarding. 
    - If you’re consistently falling short of hitting your goals, ask yourself, “why?” Are they the right goals? Are you not being realistic with yourself in terms of schedule? If not, consider rewriting your goals so they’re challenging but still achievable.

- **Relevant**:
    - It’s great to have personal development goals, but these should have their own place in your mental file cabinet and probably shouldn’t be lumped in with goals related to your professional development.

- **Time-bound**:
    - Some goals will be short-term, others long-term and all should have a clear ending point so you have regular checkpoints where you evaluate whether your current goals should be reupped or archived.

### My Goal
- I think a mid-size casual form company would be the best fit for me. Since I am very interested in interior design and excited to be in fast-paced environment, I will try to find a start-up company dealing with design or furniture stuffs. Meanwhile set up a system so I can collect resources for benchmarking. Explore popular websites and applications and get to know what is a trend right now.
