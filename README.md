# Lambda Career - LS1905

## Job search - June 03
### SMART
- **Specific**:
    - Specificity helps you know the who, what, where, and how of your goals.
    - Create an actionable plan for how you’ll get a job, who can help you, where you will go to find one, or what you need to do every day. 

- **Measurable**:
    - How do you know if you’re on track to meeting your goals?
    - Measurable goals are concrete goals like making a your daily/weekly to-do list.

- **Achievable**:
    - Goals should be motivating and rewarding. 
    - If you’re consistently falling short of hitting your goals, ask yourself, “why?” Are they the right goals? Are you not being realistic with yourself in terms of schedule? If not, consider rewriting your goals so they’re challenging but still achievable.

- **Relevant**:
    - It’s great to have personal development goals, but these should have their own place in your mental file cabinet and probably shouldn’t be lumped in with goals related to your professional development.

- **Time-bound**:
    - Some goals will be short-term, others long-term and all should have a clear ending point so you have regular checkpoints where you evaluate whether your current goals should be reupped or archived.

### My Goal
- I think a mid-size casual form company would be the best fit for me. Since I am very interested in interior design and excited to be in fast-paced environment, I will try to find a start-up company dealing with design or furniture stuffs. Meanwhile set up a system so I can collect resources for benchmarking. Explore popular websites and applications and get to know what is a trend right now.

### Take a Myers Briggs-type test
- **ESFJ: 'Consul'**
    - How did your test results compare to your understanding of yourself?
        - Results say pretty much about me. ESFJs are generous entertainers. They enjoy and joyfully observe traditions and are liberal in giving, especially where custom prescribes.
        - ESFJs see problems clearly and delegate easily, work hard and play with zest. ESFJs, as do most SJs, bear strong allegiance to rights of seniority. They willingly provide service (which embodies life's meaning) and expect the same from others.

    - Do you disagree with any aspects of your quiz results?
        - I agree with most parts of the resultl. But I don't agree `Discussing scientific theories or debating European politics isn’t likely to capture Consuls’ interest for too long.`. My background is neuroscience and my job was showing experimental data and convincing other scientist in academia.

    - How can you use this information (or your own previous understanding of our personality and work ethic) to influence how you work in teams with others?
        - People with ESFJ personality type thrive on social order and harmony, and use their warmth and social intelligence to make sure that each person knows their responsibilities and is able to get done what needs to get done

- Deliver direct feedback to at least one colleague. Remember that your feedback should be balanced, relevant, timely, and thoughtful.
    - I tried to give a feedback to one of my colleague. We talked about her code (JS) through DM. I saw somethings like syntax errors, simpler method she can fix and I deleivered  balanced and thoughtful feedback. I put an effort so she doesn't give up and get. After the conversation, she was able to solve the problem in the code.
